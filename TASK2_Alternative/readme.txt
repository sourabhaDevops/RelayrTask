Test cases info
=======================================================

Two sample testcases are written.

1. Written in Python + Selenium webdriver
	Python + Selenium is the higly recommended tools now a days for automating testcases.
	It also has unittest module which makes it easier to analyse the output.
	We are currently using this approach for writing the testcases.

2. Written in Robot Framework + Selenium
	This Framework is used as it is keyword based and very easy to understand.
	Robot testcases logs in GUI style is a plus.
	Rather than complicating the things with huge code i feel robot is the best framework for automation.
	We are currently using Robot for writing the testcases.
